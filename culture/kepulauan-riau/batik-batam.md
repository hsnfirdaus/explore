Batik Batam deserves to be one of the regional superior products, batik with the dominance of bright colors and unique batam motifs managed to steal the attention. "Batam batik is very comfortable to wear and deserves to be packaged as superior batik," said Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy (Menparekraf) Sandiaga Salahudin Uno during a working visit to the Batam Regional National Craft Council (Dekranasda), Riau Islands, Saturday (23/1/2021).

In the event, the Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy wore Batam's original batik with a light blue betel vine motif, besides that there was also batik with barking motifs and various types of fish inspired by Batam's special food. Sandiaga believes that the products produced by local craftsmen can enter the export market.
