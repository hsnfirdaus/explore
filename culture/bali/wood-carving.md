Bali, which is the epicenter of tourism in Indonesia, is not only decorated with its charming nature, but also has other attractions, one of which is the craft of carving traditional wood sculptures produced by the community in Mas Village, Ubud District, Gianyar Regency.

Since the pandemic occurred and the whole world has imposed travel restrictions, this business that was started in 1965 has experienced a drastic decline in sales.

"During this pandemic, income dropped drastically, because there were no guests. Usually it was very crowded, before this corona it was very crowded, during corona it was quiet for 5 months. But I still got orders from Germany, because he has been a subscriber for up to 25 years." said I Wayan.

For the time being, Wayan, who usually makes puppet-type statues such as Rama and Sinta, Dewa Ruci statue, Nakula Sadewa statue, and various other wayang characters can only continue to pray and try to continue to work to meet the demands of his customers from abroad.

"Now at least one or two, not many are ordering. Yes, if a wood artist like me doesn't come, tourists don't come automatically, everything goes down. All wood artists live from wood. But they still pray and work. Thankfully, one day's income is there. , the important thing is that one day there is income." Close Wayan.
